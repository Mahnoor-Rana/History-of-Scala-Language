## History-of-Scala-Language
<hr>
The project is all about HISTORY of Scala Language.

Scala is a modern programming language designed and created by Martin Odersky. The design of the language started in 2001 and was released to the public in early 2004. Martin Odersky had a huge hand in the implementation of javac (the primary Java compiler) and also designed Generic Java, a facility of generic programming that was added to the Java programming language in 2004. This is why it doesn’t come as a surprise that Scala is similar to Java in many aspects, it’s actually written to run in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).


In this Notebook we have to see the Open source projects contain entire development histories - who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
